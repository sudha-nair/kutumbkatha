    <h1>Your Family, Your Story</h1>
    <p>Preserve your family‚Äôs essence ‚Äî one story at a time.</p>

      <p>Across India, every family has a constellation of stories waiting to be told. This isn‚Äôt just about lineage. It‚Äôs about memory, meaning, and understanding where we come from.</p>
      <p>I work with families to co-create deep genealogical narratives ‚Äî story-rich, emotionally honest, and historically grounded. The final output can be anything you imagine: a coffee table book, a legacy document, or even a novelized version of your family‚Äôs journey.</p>
      <p>I hold a degree in anthropology and formal training in genealogical studies. My thesis explored how storytelling and memory shape emotional continuity across generations ‚Äî so I bring both method and deep care to this work.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Why explore your family‚Äôs story now?</h2>
      <p>Through two completed chronicles, one truth stands out. Genealogy work isn‚Äôt just retelling the past. Families come closer; identity is reclaimed; the future feels clearer; ancestors are celebrated; fading rituals and values are captured; and children learn a new depth of belonging.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Confidentiality & Ethics Matter</h2>
      <p>Everything shared is treated with utmost respect and confidentiality. You can trust that sensitive stories are held with care and without judgment. The process is guided by strong ethical principles and a deep understanding of family dynamics.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>My Team & Process</h2>
      <p>I work closely with a trusted team of two. Together, we help manage interviews, organize records, and shape the final narrative. We‚Äôre willing to travel ‚Äî because sometimes, the stories are buried in the land, the temples, the homes, or the silences of a place.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Why have someone from outside do it?</h2>
      <p>Because I bring no baggage. Only curiosity, compassion, and care. I listen to everyone, without judgment.</p>
      <p>This is <em>your</em> story. I‚Äôm here to help shape it with reverence. If finances are a concern, let‚Äôs talk. The only thing I ask is for someone in the family to take responsibility ‚Äî to open the doors and keep them open.</p>
